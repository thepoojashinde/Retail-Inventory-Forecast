An end-to-end Machine Learning and Business Analytics project that forecasts retail store sales and transforms predictions into actionable business insights through an interactive Streamlit dashboard.

Unlike notebook-centric projects, this repository follows a modular, production-inspired architecture with separate data, feature engineering, modeling, visualization, and application layers.

# 📌 Project Overview

Retail businesses constantly struggle with two major challenges:

- Overstocking products, leading to increased storage costs and markdowns.
- Understocking products, resulting in lost sales and poor customer experience.

This project develops an end-to-end demand forecasting system capable of predicting store-level daily sales while providing business stakeholders with interactive analytics for inventory planning and decision-making.

The project covers the complete machine learning lifecycle:

- Data Loading
- Data Cleaning
- Feature Engineering
- Model Training
- Hyperparameter Tuning
- Model Evaluation
- Sales Prediction
- Interactive Business Dashboard

# 📂 Dataset

**Dataset:** Rossmann Store Sales (Kaggle)

The Rossmann dataset was selected because it closely resembles real-world retail forecasting problems by combining:

- Daily historical sales
- Promotional campaigns
- School & state holidays
- Competition information
- Store metadata

### Dataset Statistics

| Metric | Value |
|---------|------:|
| Daily Sales Records | **1,017,209** |
| Retail Stores | **1,115** |
| Engineered Features | **43** |
| Forecast Target | Daily Store Sales |

|--------|--------------|
| Programming | Python |
| Data Processing | Pandas, NumPy |
| Machine Learning | Scikit-learn |
| Model Persistence | Joblib |
| Visualization | Plotly, Matplotlib |

# 🤖 Machine Learning Pipeline

The project compares multiple regression models before selecting the best-performing model.

### Models Evaluated

- Baseline Mean Regressor
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- HistGradientBoosting Regressor

Hyperparameter tuning is performed using **RandomizedSearchCV**, and models are evaluated using a time-based train-validation split suitable for forecasting problems.

---

# 📈 Model Evaluation

The trained models are evaluated using multiple regression metrics:

- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
- MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
- MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)
- R² Score

The project also generates:

- Actual vs Predicted Plot
- Residual Plot
- Residual Distribution

These visualizations help assess both predictive accuracy and model reliability.
